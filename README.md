#Data Collection:
The London Bike Sharing Dataset was acquired from Kaggle using the Kaggle API. The dataset was downloaded programmatically and extracted from a ZIP file. The main dataset file, london_merged.csv, was then read into a pandas DataFrame for further exploration and analysis.

#Data Exploration:
The dataset was explored to understand its structure and content. This included examining the number of rows and columns, data types, and the first few rows of data. Column names were renamed to preferred names for clarity and consistency. Additionally, certain columns containing numeric codes were mapped to descriptive names using dictionaries. Data cleaning steps were performed as needed, such as converting humidity values to percentage format. Finally, the cleaned dataset was exported to an Excel file named london-bike-data.xlsx, allowing for further analysis and visualization in external tools like Tableau.

#Data vizualization:
Developed a comprehensive Tableau dashboard project leveraging advanced functionalities including user-defined parameters, calculated fields, sets, and bins to create dynamic visualizations. This interactive dashboard allows users to explore and analyze data dynamically, facilitating informed decision-making by providing actionable insights based on selected filters and prompts.
